        <h2>Origins and Exodus</h2>
        <p>The empire of the sun elves, known as "Surya'Res," was born from a group of high elves who embarked on an exodus due to deep cultural and religious disagreements within their original society. Led by visionary leaders, they ventured across vast lands until they arrived at the shores of the White Sea, an expansive and unforgiving desert.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Founding and Transformation</h2>
        <p>Embracing their new surroundings, the exiles founded Surya'Res with the blessings of Anar, the radiant god of the sun. Over time, Anar's divine influence began to transform the elves. Their skin deepened in color, taking on the hues of desert sands, and they acquired an innate resilience to the sun's harsh rays, gaining sustenance and strength from its energy.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p> The sun elves are deeply religious, they believe in one god, Anar the sun god. They believe Anar is the creator of all, and that praying to another god is a sin. The Surya'Res is full of temples dedicated to Anar, called Ma'azhara, and they function as centers for society. In the empire of the sun elves, the role of priests is highly esteemed and regarded as a sacred duty. These priests, also known as "Lightkeepers," are entrusted with the responsibility of preserving and transmitting the teachings and wisdom bestowed by Anar, the god of the sun.  The Lightkeepers play a central role in guiding the sun elves to live in harmony with Anar's divine principles. The Lightkeepers are entrusted with ancient scrolls, tablets, and manuscripts that contain the teachings and stories of Anar. These texts hold the wisdom of generations and provide insights into the righteous way of living the sun elves should abide by. The Lightkeepers serve as educators and mentors within the community. They share the teachings of Anar through lessons, sermons, and personal guidance. They help sun elves understand the principles of compassion, unity, and respect for the natural world. The Lightkeepers oversee the rituals and ceremonies that honor Anar. From sunrise prayers to sacred dances that emulate the sun's radiant movements, these rituals serve as powerful expressions of devotion and gratitude. The counsel of the Lightkeepers is sought by rulers, nobles, and city-state leaders. Their insights and guidance are instrumental in shaping the empire's policies, decisions, and interactions with other cultures. To become a Lightkeeper, individuals undergo a rigorous initiation and training process. They are chosen for their strong connection to Anar and their dedication to upholding the teachings. Initiates study under experienced Lightkeepers, learning the ancient tomes, sacred symbols, and esoteric knowledge necessary for their role. The Lightkeepers are deeply respected by the sun elves, and their guidance is cherished. They provide a link between the mortal realm and the divine light of Anar. Their presence is a source of comfort, inspiration, and reassurance in times of uncertainty. </p>
<br>
        <h2>The seven commandments of Anar</h2>
        <p>It is said that when the sun elves reached their home, Anar whispered to Elion his seven commandments to which his chosen people shall abide. So it was that the Sun elves lived following the commandments to appease Anar and revere him. The seven commandments are as follows:
<br>1.	Hearken, for there shall be no homage given unto any other, be they mortal or deity, but unto Anar, the God of the Sun.
<br>2.	In the hallowed name of Anar, let no word of disparagement cross thy lips. Show reverence, and His grace shall be thy reward.
<br>3.	Harm not the innocent, spill not the blood of the blameless. Instead, be their shield, and let love be thy shield.
<br>4.	Thieve not from another, but seek and thou shalt find, for Anar shall provide unto the honest supplicant.
<br>5.	Defile not the sacred act of love through wantonness, for the sanctity of love shall shield the innocent from the path of iniquity.
<br>6.	Set apart the day of thy return unto me as sacred, and grieve not for those who depart, for they shall dwell in my abode.
<br>7.	Institute a system to uphold and enforce my commandments, that they may be a binding covenant upon all my children, regardless of station or kin.
</p>
<br>
         <h2>The blessed flowers of Anar Anar'Azhar:</h2>
        <p>When the sun elves broke their soul gems, they knew that meant renouncing immortality, yet they didn’t want to turn into mortals like the humans, trusting in Anar he would reward hi people. At their arrival to the promised land, they found the blessed flowers of Anar (Anar’Azhar). This flowers when consumed they provide health and prolong life expectancy, providing the Sun elves with very long-life spans. When a sun elf leaves the empire, their connection to the magical essence of the flowers weakens. The flowers loose most of its magical properties when they are taken outside the white sea. When a sun elf ventures away from the empire, they can feel the lost connection to the land, aging will not start immediately but if for a prolonged time an Anaryr does not return home he will age like a mortal human. Sun elves who venture away from the white sea undertake periodic pilgrimages back to the empire to renew their connection to the flowers and to Anar. The blessed flowers are a symbol of more than just long life; they represent unity, loyalty, and devotion to Anar and the empire.</p>

<br>
        <h2>Political Structure:</h2>
        <p>Emperor and the Council of the Five: At the helm of the empire stands the Emperor, the supreme ruler and the leader of the capital city. However, due to the decentralized nature of the empire formed by city-states, the Emperor's authority is balanced by the Council of the Five. Comprising leaders from the five most influential city-states, this council serves as an advisory body, ensuring that the concerns and perspectives of each city-state are taken into account in decision-making.</p>
        <br>
        <p>City-State Autonomy: Each city-state is governed by its own local leadership, including a governor and city council. This autonomy allows for tailored governance that addresses the unique needs of each city-state's populace. While the Emperor sets the broader course of the empire, city-states retain their distinct cultural identities and self-governance to a certain extent.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Noble Houses: Within the empire, noble families hold considerable influence. These families have traditionally amassed power through various means, such as trade, military prowess, and alliances. Each noble family often governs its own territory, where they oversee local matters, contribute to the economy, and play a vital role in maintaining the cohesion of the empire.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Political Intrigue and Alliances: The interplay between noble families adds complexity to the political landscape. Alliances and rivalries among noble houses shape the empire's trajectory. Marriages, trade agreements, and shared goals often bind these families together, while political maneuvers and power struggles are not uncommon.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Justice system</h2>
        <p>Divine Justice: The empire's justice system is intricately tied to its religious beliefs. The clergy of Anar preside over the courts, administering justice based on the 7 commandments. Trials often include rituals and oaths invoking divine guidance, seeking to align the legal process with the will of Anar. The concept of balance and harmony, central to the faith, influences the way judgments are made.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Theocracy and Law: The intertwining of religious and legal matters has resulted in a theocratic aspect to the empire's governance. High-ranking clergy members hold positions within the legal system, ensuring that the teachings of Anar are upheld in both spiritual and civic matters. However, checks and balances exist to prevent an overreach of religious authority.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Marriage and relationships in the empire:</h2>
        <p>Sacred unions: Relationships in the sun elves empire are viewed as sacred unions with spiritual significance. Marriages are seen as a way to connect with divine forces, and blessings from Anar representing the sun and life could be sought. The usual process to getting married is made by the mothers, as they meet and arrange the meetings between a Son and Daughter. After the meeting the children will discuss with their mothers if they want to proceed with the courting. To note it may happen that the two meet outside of arranged meeting, in these cases they will express the will to their mother to start courting each-other. In the sun elves’ eyes there is no getting out of marriage, as they made a promise to each other in front of Anar this promise cannot be broken. The ritual of marriage encompasses 3 days in the first day man and women enjoy festivities separated. In the second it’s where the actual marriage takes place, as the sun rises the spouses make the sacred promise to each other “I shall provide unconditional love, in my arms you shall find peace, I will stand by your side until Anar calls you back, and in his house, we shall fall for each other again.” After this promises each one makes places an Anar’Azhar on a plate, then the temple priest holds the plate up towards the sun, the flowers will burn in a sign of acceptance from Anar. In the third and final all enjoy festivities together usually with lavish meals and traditional dances.</p>

As the day approaches, sun elves engage in preparations by cleaning and decorating their homes and places of worship. They gather fragrant desert flowers and light candles or oil lamps to symbolize the radiant light of Anar. At sunrise on the day of Anar's Radiant Rest, all work and worldly activities come to a halt. Sun elves set aside their daily tasks and responsibilities, focusing solely on matters of the spirit. Families and communities come together in communal worship spaces or homes. They engage in prayers, songs, and readings from sacred texts that express gratitude for Anar's light and blessings. They also dance and enjoy each other’s company As the sun sets and the day comes to an end, sun elves break their fast with a festive meal.

<br>
        <h2>Military:</h2>
        <p>Since its inception, the Empire of the Sun Elves has dedicated its resources and efforts to ensure its defense, solidifying the creation of a formidable and enduring military force. At the pinnacle of this martial hierarchy stands the esteemed position of Kharinit Shel Anar, the General of Anar, who holds supreme command over the empire's armed forces. This military juggernaut is meticulously organized into seven Tihar, or legions, each entrusted with unique responsibilities and territories. Among these, Anariel found his calling in the elite Anarhatal, a distinguished special forces unit that operates directly under the command of the Kharinit Shel Anar. Comprising the crème de la crème of the Anaryr, these soldiers represent the epitome of Sun Elf martial prowess. Within the Anarhatal, specialized teams known as Plahyr, consisting of 16 skilled warriors, form the backbone of this elite force. These units, however, further subdivide into Shihads, comprised of eight individuals, and Naraths, which consist of four soldiers, each with their unique roles and missions. For covert and stealthy operations, the Anarhatal employs the nimble and agile Nar-Attas, teams of two highly-trained operatives. The road to becoming a Muhtamal, a title signifying one's potential and readiness, is a grueling 11-year journey of relentless training within the Anarhatal. Only after enduring this arduous path can a soldier partake in the crucial missions that safeguard the empire. Equipped to withstand the harshest desert conditions, the Anarhatal are outfitted with specialized gear. Their armor boasts a unique feature, a rear compartment capable of storing up to 5 liters of water. This ingenious design allows a trained Anaryr to survive independently in the unforgiving desert for two weeks while maintaining combat readiness. Additionally, the soldiers wear enchanted masks connected to their water supply via a tube. These masks are enchanted to enable the Anarhatal to cast the "Message" spell, facilitating communication within a distance of 36 meters, a vital asset for seamless coordination during their missions.

        <h2>Indepth stories</h2>
        <br>
        <h2>The story of the Tziach (exodus)</h2>
        <p>Long ago, the sun elves were an integral part of the vast High Elven Empire, their beliefs diverging from the mainstream. They held a sacred reverence for Anar, the radiant god of the sun, and abhorred the practice of using soul gems to attain immortality. This ideological difference led them to be marginalized and treated as an inferior caste within their own society.
<br>Amidst this tension, a fateful incident unfolded within the royal gardens. The youngest prince, a compassionate soul named Elion, stumbled upon a scene that would forever change his destiny. A young believer in Anar, a girl named Lira, was being unjustly tormented by a guard. Incensed by the cruelty, Elion intervened, the struggle continued as the guard was intent in killing the girl under the strikes of his whip. In a moment of desperation, Elion used his arcane powers and killed the guard saving the girl in the process.
<br>Haunted by this encounter, Elion embarked on a mission to bridge the growing chasm between his people. His pleas for unity and understanding fell on deaf ears within the royal court. The High Elven rulers clung to their divisive policies, exacerbating the divide. Elion's persistence fueled his determination, but the division within his homeland remained intractable.
<br>The climactic moment came during a grand assembly of the High Elven elite. Elion, resolute in his convictions, took the stage. As rain poured down from the heavens, a reflection of the turmoil within, he openly declared his faith in Anar and denounced the soul gems as an affront to the divine will. With a defiant gesture, he shattered his own soul gem, sending shards of iridescent light cascading in all directions, and in that moment a ray of light shinned upon Elion. It was a proclamation of his unwavering devotion and an act of defiance against a system he could no longer abide.
<br>The royal family reacted with fury, banishing Elion and all who shared his beliefs from the empire. Dispossessed and cast adrift, the sun elves embarked on a journey of exile and discovery. Years passed as they roamed, seeking a new homeland where they could live in harmony with their faith. Eventually, guided by visions and an unyielding hope, they reached the borders of the vast white sea a desolate expanse that seemed devoid of life.
<br>It was here that Anar's presence was most keenly felt. As they ventured deeper into the desert, they discovered the blessed flowers, delicate and radiant, thriving in the harshest of conditions. Legends whispered that these flowers were touched by the very essence of Anar, and that their petals held the gift of longevity and inner strength. As the sun elves partook of these blossoms, their skin transformed, adapting to the sun's fiery embrace. No longer did the sun scorch their flesh; instead, it infused them with energy and resilience, enabling them to thrive in their arid realm.
<br>United by their shared experiences and newfound vitality, the sun elves established a civilization along the white sea's shimmering shores. Guided by their unwavering faith and the memories of their exodus, they forged an empire rooted in the teachings of Anar.
<br>In this new homeland, the sun elves found solace, strength, and unity. Their journey of exodus thought them the strength they have when united, and it became the foundation of their identity. The shattered soul gem and the radiant flowers became symbols of their unwavering faith, their unyielding spirit, and their determination to live free from oppression.
<br>And so, the tale of the sun elves' exodus became a testament to the enduring power of faith, the pursuit of freedom, and the belief that even in the darkest of times, the light of Anar would guide them forward.
